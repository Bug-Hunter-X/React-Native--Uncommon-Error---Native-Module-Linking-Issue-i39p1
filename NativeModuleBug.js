This error occurs when using a third-party library or native module that isn't properly linked or configured within your React Native project. It can manifest in various ways, such as unexpected behavior, crashes, or build failures.  The root cause often lies in inconsistencies between the native code (iOS or Android) and the JavaScript part of your React Native app.  This can involve missing dependencies, incorrect configurations in your project's build files (like Podfile for iOS or build.gradle for Android), or version mismatches between the native module and your React Native version.
