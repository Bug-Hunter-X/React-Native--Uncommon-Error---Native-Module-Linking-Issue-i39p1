# React Native Native Module Linking Issue

This repository demonstrates a common yet often-difficult-to-diagnose issue in React Native development: problems with linking native modules.  Incorrectly linked native modules can lead to runtime errors or failures during the build process.

The `NativeModuleBug.js` file showcases the problem.  The `NativeModuleSolution.js` provides the corrected implementation.

## Problem
The problem lies in improper linking of a native module. The specific problem encountered (and solution) might vary depending on the native module used; this example simulates a common situation.

## Solution
The solution involves meticulously checking the configuration of the native module within your React Native project (often involving editing Podfiles for iOS and build.gradle files for Android).
