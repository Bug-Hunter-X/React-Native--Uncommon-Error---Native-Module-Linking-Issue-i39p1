The solution depends on the specific native module and the nature of the linking error.  Common steps:

1. **Verify native dependencies:** Ensure all necessary native dependencies are correctly installed.  For iOS, this typically involves using `pod install` within the iOS directory of your React Native project. For Android, check your `build.gradle` files for all necessary dependencies.
2. **Clean and rebuild:** A clean build can often resolve linking issues.  Try cleaning your project's build cache and rebuilding from scratch.
3. **Check Linking Instructions:** Always carefully follow the linking instructions provided by the native module's documentation. This often involves running specific commands or modifying build files.
4. **Verify module installation:** Confirm that the native module is correctly installed and available. You can check in the node_modules folder or the package manager logs.
5. **Inspect Build Logs:** Carefully examine the build logs for any error messages that point to the missing or incorrect linking. These logs often provide detailed information about the location and nature of the error.
6. **Version compatibility:** Make sure the native module is compatible with your React Native version and other dependencies.
